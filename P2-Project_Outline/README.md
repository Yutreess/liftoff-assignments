# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview

RankedVote will host polls for users to have a
place to eaily handle voting, especially in large groups. 
Specifically, this will focus on hosting polls using a voting system of choice by the poll's creator. The most common voting system, First-Past-The-Post (or for short "Plurality voting") can be undemocratic when dealing with more than one choice. For this reason, perhaps a user would want to use Ranked Choice Voting, or Approval Voting. With this application, the poll creator has the power to decide which voting system they will use.

Government Simulation role-players face the issue of
holding more complicated voting systems for their elections.
Proportional Representation systems such as D'Hondt Method 
and calculating the need of Overhang Seats take some time to calculate for when counting votes. This application would host a way for government simulation role-players to give how their legislative body is structured, how the voting system works, and generate a poll for this body to give to their audiences to more easily conduct elections. Such a feature will also be used by those wanting to implement different voting systens in real life governments, and provide an educational tool to demonstrate how some systems work to their audiences.

### Features

User Login: User profiles keeping track of a user's hosted polls, polls they voted in, and how they voted in those polls.

Vote Confirmations: Polls will give to the creator or other authorized admins the usernames of every voter, and how they voted, to ensure only users they're familiar with have voted.

Search: Users can look through the database of polls to find where they want to vote, given the creator has given permission.

Social Media Links: User profiles will give integration with a user's account on Discord, Twitter, Facebook, and Slack to perform those platforms' respective features to connect users in the social media platform they desire to use.

Poll times: Polls can be told to stop allowing votes after a certain condition is met, such as after a specific time and date, or after a certain amount of votes are counted, or both.

### What I'll Have to Learn

I will have to find out a graphic to present results of polls, such as pie charts.

I will see if I may need to find an API or technology that may work better for social media integration.
